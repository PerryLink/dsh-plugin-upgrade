# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Host pins move to `0.1.7-rc.2`; re-verified against that host line. Every `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` dev/test dependency now pins `0.1.7-rc.2`, the `dshWorkshop.compatibility.dshVersions` timeline appends `0.1.7-rc.2`, and the compatibility baseline in every README records the `dsh-v0.1.7-rc.2` host. The declared host ranges (`engines.dsh` and the `peerDependencies` union) are deliberately **unchanged** — they already admit `0.1.7-rc.2`, and a range is what the manifest accepts, not what has been tested.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-09-24
### Changed

- The host pins move to `0.1.7-rc.1`: the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-skill` dev/test pin moves from `0.1.7-alpha.2`, and `dshWorkshop.compatibility.dshVersions` records `0.1.7-rc.1` (appended — the timeline is append-only). Re-verified against that host line. The declared peer band is deliberately **unchanged** and still carries all four segments: `0.1.7-rc.1` already satisfies its `>=0.1.7-0 <0.2.0` clause, and `P1` forbids collapsing the band. The `compat.yml` probe matrix still covers `0.1.2-rc.1`, `0.1.5-rc.2`, `0.1.6-alpha.2` and `0.1.7-alpha.2`; the `0.1.6-alpha.2` legC anchor is deliberate and stays. The five-language READMEs and `AGENTS.md` now name `0.1.7-rc.1` as the dev/test line, and no seam, card, catalog or fixture fact changes.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- A checkout ruler: `checkout/host-surface.mts`, `tsconfig.checkout.json` and `typecheck:checkout` (`tsc -p tsconfig.checkout.json --noEmit`). The probe mirrors the real call sites — the Schemastery `Config` from `index.mjs`, the exact `SkillRegistration` object `apply()` hands `ctx.skills.register()`, and a real `Context` + `SkillRegistry` + `ctx.effect()` as in `test/plugin.test.mjs` — and the three `@deepseek-ai/*` specifiers this package really imports (`index.mjs` → `schemastery`; `test/plugin.test.mjs` → `cordis`, `dsh-skill`) are aliased to the local harness checkout's built types. The `@deepseek-ai/*` names under `fixtures/` are synthetic scanner inputs, including packages that no longer exist, so they are deliberately not mapped. It is never executed; it exists so a host-line shape change fails against the checkout instead of at a user's first mount.

### Changed

- The published line this package checks against moves to `0.1.7-alpha.2`: the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-skill` dev/test pin moves from `0.1.5-rc.2`, `@deepseek-ai/cordis` to `^4.0.4` and `@deepseek-ai/schemastery` to `^3.18.4`; the `0.1.7` tuple gains its own clause on the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-skill` peer band; `dshWorkshop.compatibility.dshVersions` records `0.1.7-alpha.2`; and the `compat.yml` probe matrix now covers `0.1.2-rc.1`, `0.1.5-rc.2`, `0.1.6-alpha.2` and `0.1.7-alpha.2`. This is a correctness fix, not a tightening: under npm semver's prerelease rule a comparator set whose only prerelease comparators sit on earlier `[major, minor, patch]` tuples cannot admit a later alpha, so the three-clause band could not admit the very host this release targets. The three existing clauses are unchanged, in place and in order; `P1` still forbids collapsing them. The lockfile now resolves exactly one `cordis` and one `schemastery` copy, so the two-copy `Volatile` typing trap cannot occur here.
- The five-language READMEs name the `0.1.7-alpha.2` line and quote the four-clause band; `AGENTS.md`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and the checks block are brought in line with the declared state (the prose commit `070309e`), including the `AGENTS.md` peer-segment note that still said the package keeps "both segments" and the dev/test-pin sentence that still said `0.1.5-rc.2`.

### Fixed

- `pnpm run check` (`tsc -p tsconfig.check.json`) had been red since the corridor index landed: 24 `TS7006` (implicitly-`any` parameter) errors, all of them in two committed checked-JS source files that no build step generates (`lib/route.mjs` 8, `lib/scan-0.1.6.mjs` 16). The same 24 errors reddened `pnpm run typecheck:ci`, whose config includes the same file set. The defects were genuine rather than checker noise — those two files were the only checked-JS sources in the repo whose functions carried no JSDoc. Every annotation was derived from the function body and its call sites and mirrors the sibling catalog `lib/scan.mjs`, which already passes the same checker; the change is comment-only (all 58 added lines sit inside JSDoc blocks), `allowJs`, `checkJs` and `noImplicitAny: true` are untouched, no file was dropped from `include`, and no `@ts-nocheck` or `@ts-ignore` was added. With the shipping surface type-checking, the checkout ruler compiles what actually ships (`index.mjs`, `lib/**`, `scripts/**`) instead of only the probe, which is what the ruler was for.
- **The documentation still described the retired "one package per hop" model.** `2.0.0`
  introduced the corridor index (`lib/route.mjs`) and folded the `0.1.5-rc.2` →
  `0.1.6-alpha.2` corridor in as `legC`, but the surrounding prose had not caught up: the
  internal `AGENTS.md` still said the package "upgrades plugins across `0.1.3-alpha.1` →
  `0.1.5-rc.1` and nothing else" and that "a hop after `0.1.5-rc.1` … is a new package"; the
  `legC` card still called itself the new package `dsh-plugin-upgrade-016`; the skill
  frontmatter still carried a single `corridor:` key and a `whenToUse` that told the model a
  later hop is a new package; and all five READMEs described one merged corridor with two
  legs, never naming `legC`. Corrected here, with the two corridors now named consistently
  everywhere (`legAB` = `0.1.3-alpha.1` → `0.1.5-rc.1`, `legC` = `0.1.5-rc.2` →
  `0.1.6-alpha.2`) and the "a new corridor adds a card and an index row, not a package" rule
  stated wherever the old rule was.
- **`test/card.test.mjs` had no gate for the second corridor.** The evidence-binding parity
  check only pinned the `legAB` card to `lib/scan.mjs`. It now also pins the `legC` card to
  `lib/scan-0.1.6.mjs` (ids, order, severities), asserts `legC`'s `CARD_ONLY` is empty,
  asserts the two catalogs share no seam id, and asserts the skill frontmatter names both
  corridors while the superseded "a new package" phrasing is gone.
  `scripts/verify-artifacts.mjs` checks the packaged `SKILL.md` frontmatter for both
  corridors instead of the retired single `corridor:` key.
- No functional change: `index.mjs`, `lib/**`, `cordis.patch.yml`, `fixtures/**` and the
  cards' seam facts are untouched. `package.json` changes only documentation fields
  (`dshWorkshop.capability.expected`, and `compatibility.dshVersions` gains
  `0.1.6-alpha.2`, which `peerDependencies` already admitted). The gate chain is re-run in
  full; the published `2.0.1` tarball is unaffected and this lands with the next release.
- **The family-size claim was one release behind.** All five READMEs said this package is
  "one of the **40** DeepSeek Harness plugins"; the family roster is **41** (`PerryLink/dsh-kit`
  states 41 in both the tagline and the same family line, and `dsh-wechat` left the family).
  Corrected in all five in the same commit.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- **The package description named the retired corridor card instead of this one.** `package.json`
  described 2.0.0 as "the merged version-locked `0.1.3-alpha.1` -> `0.1.5-rc.1` corridor card …
  over one 20-seam catalog" and never mentioned the second corridor. 2.0.0 is the opposite of
  version-locked: the scanner reads the caller peer band and routes between two closed corridors
  (`0.1.3-alpha.1` -> `0.1.5-rc.1` as legs A+B, and `0.1.5-rc.2` -> `0.1.6-alpha.2` as leg C).
  The text was corrected in the repository on 2026-09-20 (`b543400`); npm metadata is immutable
  per version, so 2.0.1 is the release that carries the corrected description to the registry,
  and with it to every catalog that copies an author's own words.
- No functional change: `lib/route.mjs`, `lib/scan.mjs`, `lib/scan-0.1.6.mjs`, the cards, the
  skill body and the CLI are byte-identical to 2.0.0.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-19

### Changed

- The retired name returns as the new-generation single package: one package, one corridor index. It absorbs the merged corridor 0.1.3-alpha.1 -> 0.1.5-rc.1 that lived in dsh-plugin-upgrade-015 (legs A+B, 20 seams) and it is the package the later corridor 0.1.5-rc.2 -> 0.1.6-alpha.2 (E1-E5, from dsh-plugin-upgrade-016) is folded into.
- The skill and the CLI are one entry point: the scanner detects the caller peer band and routes to the matching corridor; the corridor index is the growth point (a new corridor adds a card and an index row, not a new package).
- Names: the skill id is plugin-upgrade and the CLI is dsh-plugin-upgrade-scan.

### Supersedes

- dsh-plugin-upgrade-015 (npm 0.1.1) - its corridors are carried here.
- dsh-plugin-upgrade-rc1 and the old 0.1.x line of this name.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-12

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- **Merged corridor: one package for `0.1.3-alpha.1 → 0.1.5-rc.1`.** This package supersedes
  the two version-locked npm names `dsh-plugin-upgrade` (leg A, `0.1.3-alpha.1 →
  0.1.5-alpha.1`, seams `S1`–`S10` + `M1`) and `dsh-plugin-upgrade-rc1` (leg B,
  `0.1.5-alpha.1 → 0.1.5-rc.1`, seams `C1`, `C2`, `C4`, `C5`, `H1`–`H4`, `P1`). The npm name
  is new, so the version line restarts at `0.1.0`; the two retired names stay on the registry
  and their content is now historical.
- **One 20-seam catalog** — `lib/scan.mjs` carries both legs in catalog order (`S3`, `S8`,
  `S9`, `M1`, `S4`, `S5`, `S6`, `S7`, `S2`, `S1`, `S10`, `C1`, `C2`, `P1`, `C4`, `C5`, `H1`,
  `H2`, `H4`, `H3`) behind one CLI, one skill and one id-parity gate.
- **Seam `C3` was folded into `M1`.** Leg B's `C3` was the same defect as leg A's `M1` (a
  local gate compiling a stale type line), so the merged catalog has one seam carrying both
  causes: an unresolvable `tsconfig` `paths` alias and dev/test types pinned at
  `0.1.5-alpha.*`. `C3` is no longer a seam id — `--seams C3` matches nothing, `types.d.ts`
  does not accept it, and the merged card records the old spelling only in its fold notes.
- **Merged card with two labelled legs** —
  `skills/plugin-upgrade/references/v0.1.3-alpha.1-to-v0.1.5-rc.1.md`: a preamble (the
  span, why it ends at rc.1, how to read it), **§1 Leg A** and **§2 Leg B** each carrying the
  retired card's full text, evidence and `path:line` citations, and **§3 the merged 20-seam
  index**.
- **Leg-routing skill body** — the skill is now `plugin-upgrade` (renamed directory,
  frontmatter, Config default and bundle row). Its body routes the caller to the leg that
  matches the peer band, and both legs' original frontmatter routing hints are preserved in
  the body.
- **Fixtures for both legs** — leg A's TypeScript/session-oriented pair is vendored as
  `fixtures/leg-a-bad-repo` / `fixtures/leg-a-good-repo`; the client-slot pair stays at
  `fixtures/bad-repo` / `fixtures/good-repo`. Each leg therefore has a bad fixture that trips
  its error-severity seams and a good fixture that stays clean.

### Changed

- The scanner CLI is now `dsh-plugin-upgrade-scan` (`scripts/scan-0.1.5.mjs`, plus the
  skill-local `skills/plugin-upgrade/scripts/scan-0.1.5.mjs`); the cordis row is
  `dsh-plugin-upgrade`.
- The dev/test pin and the monthly compat probe move to the published `0.1.5-rc.2` line (the
  newest published types verify the same seam catalog), while `dshWorkshop.compatibility.dshVersions`
  lists `0.1.2-rc.1` and `0.1.5-rc.2`. The peer band still keeps both segments
  (`>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 || >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0`) — `P1` forbids collapsing it.
- Rename the four translated READMEs to `README-<lang>.md`. npm selects the package-page readme as the first markdown file matching its `{README,README.*}` glob (`@npmcli/package-json`, publish path), and that glob order puts `README.<lang>.md` ahead of `README.md` — so npm was serving the Simplified-Chinese file for this package too (measured on 15/15 sampled packages of the family). The new names sit outside the glob, so the English source is served again. No content changed apart from the language-switcher link each translation holds to its siblings, and the repo readme gate still passes. Takes effect with the next release; an already-published version cannot gain a corrected readme retroactively.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-10 · retired package `dsh-plugin-upgrade-rc1` (leg B)

> `plugin-upgraderc1`, CLI `dsh-plugin-upgrade-rc1-scan`). Their merged equivalents are in
> `[Unreleased]`. Leg B's seam `C3` below is the merged `M1`, and this entry is retained
> verbatim apart from that fold.*

### Added

- **Bundled agent skill `plugin-upgraderc1`** — the version-locked `0.1.5-alpha.1 →
  0.1.5-rc.1` corridor: a 6-step fix-and-verify loop plus the corridor card with the
  from→to mapping, the seam catalog and the rewrite recipes.
- **Zero-dependency seam scanner** (`dsh-plugin-upgrade-rc1-scan`, also
  `dsh-plugin-upgrade-rc1/scan`) — reports `file:line` facts for ten seams re-read from the
  harness tag range on 2026-09-10; exit `1` on any error-severity hit.
- **Ten-seam catalog** — `C1` the bare client slot `conversation` deleted with no alias
  (silent unmount), `C2` the `dsh-client-ui-sidebar-textpreview` →
  `…-sidebar-documentpreview` package rename, `M1` the client-side false green from a stale
  type line or an unresolvable `tsconfig` `paths` alias (leg B's card spelled this seam `C3`;
  it is now one seam with leg A's `M1`), `C4` the new global main-panel model
  and the `usePanelInfo` standard prop, `C5` the `sidebar.right.tab.document` document
  preview slot and the `rightbar` → `rightbar.session` parent change, `H1` the two new
  fail-closed session event types, `H2` the `present` tool taking the `'present'` tool-view
  key, `H3` the additive capabilities (card-only, no detector), `H4` the DeepSeek adapter's
  default advisory catalog now led by `deepseek-flash`, and `P1` the peer-range trap where
  `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0` alone rejects `0.1.5-rc.1`.
- **`C1` ruling and rewrite recipe** — the removal is documented as a **public
  extension-point break** (no alias, no shim, no upstream deprecation note, and
  `ctx.slots.inject()` never fires without the declaration), with the
  `conversation` → `main.conversation` / `main` recipe and a real-browser exit criterion.
- **Honest blast-radius record** — the card states that the family's own client halves use
  eight slot keys, all of which survive in rc.1, so this hop is latent breakage for them and
  actual breakage only for third-party halves that targeted the bare key.
- **`M1` (leg B's `C3`) and `P1` as structured checks** — they resolve `tsconfig` `paths` and
  the declared peer band instead of matching text, mirroring leg A's `M1` treatment.
- **Card↔catalog parity gate** — `test/card.test.mjs` asserts that the card and
  `lib/scan.mjs` name exactly the same seam ids with the same severities, turning the
  evidence-binding rule into a machine gate.
- **Plugin surface** — `enabled`, `skillName`, `skillsRoot`, `userInvocable` config keys; the
  skill registers through the injected `skills` service and unregisters with its effect
  disposer. A missing bundle, an empty body or a nameless frontmatter fails the mount loud.
- **Evidence seal** — `docs/EVIDENCE.md` records the command and the observed output behind
  every card claim, and marks what could not be verified.
- **Gates** — `node --test` against a real Cordis `Context` and the real `SkillRegistry`,
  five-language README consistency, self-contained import resolution, and a packed-tarball
  artifact check that also proves `test/`, `fixtures/` and `.github/` never ship.
- **Family-standard CI** — 3 OS × 2 Node `ci.yml`, a monthly `compat.yml` probe against the
  published `0.1.5-rc.1` line, OpenSSF `scorecard.yml`, the `plugin-doctor.yml` static R/K
  gate, and a tag-triggered `release.yml` that gates, publishes to npm with provenance and
  creates the GitHub Release behind an idempotent guard.
