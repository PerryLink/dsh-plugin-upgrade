# Evidence · `dsh-plugin-upgrade-0.1.3-0.1.5` (merged `0.1.3-alpha.1` → `0.1.5-rc.1`)

Every upstream claim in the merged version card
(`skills/plugin-upgrade-015/references/v0.1.3-alpha.1-to-v0.1.5-rc.1.md`) and every
`action` string in `lib/scan.mjs` traces to a command recorded here, re-run on
**2026-09-09** (leg A's wave) and **2026-09-10** (leg B's tag-range diff) against the read-only
harness checkout at `D:\deepseek-harness`, the leg-A checkout at `19d2e38480`, and the
read-only family workspace at `D:\Projects\dsh\plugins`.

This file holds the records of both legs of the merged span:

- **§1–§10 below are leg B's records** (`0.1.5-alpha.1 → 0.1.5-rc.1`), kept verbatim from the
  retired `dsh-plugin-upgrade-rc1`, against the merged card's **§2 Leg B**;
- **§A at the end is leg A's provenance pointer** (`0.1.3-alpha.1 → 0.1.5-alpha.1`), against
  the merged card's **§1 Leg A**.

Toolchain used: `node v22.22.3`, `npm 11.16.0`, `pnpm 11.21.0` (Windows).

Nothing in this file is copied from another project's documentation; each block is the
observed output of the command above it. Where a claim could not be verified it is marked
**unverified** and is not used by the card.

## 2. Client slot catalog: 57 → 61 keys, `conversation` deleted

`packages/extensions/cordis-client-runner/src/client/slot-catalog.ts` is the public catalog a
plugin author reads through Inspect `Slots.listSubTree`. Extracting every `key: '<name>'`
and diffing the two tags:

```console
alpha1 count: 57  rc1 count: 61
--- removed ---
conversation
--- added ---
main, main.conversation, rightbar.session, sidebar.panellist, sidebar.right.tab.document
```

Implementation side, same file path at both tags
(`packages/client/ui-conversation/src/client/apply.ts`):

```console
$ dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1:.../apply.ts:217     name: 'conversation',
$ dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1:.../apply.ts:220        name: 'main.conversation',
$ dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1:.../apply.ts:388        slots.inject('main', function* () {
$ dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1:.../apply.ts:390          name: 'main',
$ dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1:.../apply.ts:391          key: 'conversation',
$ dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1:.../apply.ts:392          children: { 'main.conversation': { kind: 'single', scope: 'session-maybe' } },
```

No alias survives:

```console
$ git -C D:\deepseek-harness grep -n "name: 'conversation'" dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1 -- packages
dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1:packages/client/ui-agent-preset/tests/apply.client.spec.ts:135:    name: 'conversation',
```

That single hit is a test fixture, not an implementation. The public contract that makes the
removal silent is quoted verbatim from the same tag's
`packages/extensions/cordis-client-runner/src/client/api-catalog.ts` (`SERVICE_API`, key
`slots`):

> `inject(key: keyof SlotMap & string, callback: () => SlotInjectionEffect): () => void`
> "Install an effect for each declaration lifetime of a slot. The callback runs synchronously
> when the declaration already exists; otherwise it runs inside the declaring `register()`
> call after the declaration is committed."

Upstream ships **no** deprecation or migration note for the removal: the only
`docs/capability-seams.md` change in the range is one added service row (§4 below), and no
document names `conversation`.

## 3. Package rename

```console
$ git show dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1:packages/client/ui-sidebar-textpreview/package.json      # .name
@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-sidebar-textpreview
$ git show dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1:packages/client/ui-sidebar-documentpreview/package.json     # .name
@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-sidebar-documentpreview

$ git ls-tree -d --name-only dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1 packages/client/ | Select-String sidebar
packages/client/ui-sidebar-files
packages/client/ui-sidebar-right
packages/client/ui-sidebar-textpreview
packages/client/ui-sidebar
$ git ls-tree -d --name-only dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1 packages/client/ | Select-String sidebar
packages/client/ui-sidebar-documentpreview
packages/client/ui-sidebar-files
packages/client/ui-sidebar-right
packages/client/ui-sidebar
```

The old directory and package name are gone in rc.1 with no shim package.

## 4. Host-side additions

```console
$ git diff dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1..dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1 -- packages/core/session/src
 known-event-types.ts | +  'deliverables/presented',
 known-event-types.ts | +  'subagent/catalog',
 types.ts             | -  ... In v2 the ...   +  ... The ...

$ git ls-tree -d --name-only dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1 packages/fs/
...,packages/fs/tool-present,...        # absent from the alpha.1 listing
$ git show dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1:packages/fs/tool-present/src/index.ts   # line 39
    name: 'present',

$ git show dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1:packages/client/ui-deliverables/src/client/index.ts   # line 62

$ git diff <range> -- docs/capability-seams.md
+  pkg_command_feedback["command-feedback"]
+  svc_sessionFeedback["ctx.sessionFeedback<br/>Session-level feedback recorder"]
+ | `ctx.sessionFeedback` | `core` | [`command-feedback`](...) | ... |

$ git ls-tree --name-only dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1 docs/session-format-status.md   # (no output)
$ git show dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1:docs/session-format-status.md                     # new file
latestReleasedVersion: 3
evidenceTag: dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1
```

`docs/session-format-status.md` is **new in rc.1** and its release record still points at
`dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1`; it states "An alpha, beta, or release-candidate product publication
establishes released Session-format obligations."

The `ctx.layout` / `ctx.workspaces` / `TYPE_API` additions are quoted in the card; their
source is the `api-catalog.ts` diff of the same range, which adds
`selectPanel(panelId: MainPanelId | null): void`, `beginNavigation(): AbortSignal`,
`openSession(sessionId: SessionId): void`,
`openWorkspace(workspaceId: WorkspaceId, beforeOpen?: (sessionId: SessionId) => void): Promise<void>`,
`forkSession(sessionId: SessionId): Promise<void>` and
`export type MainPanelId = Branded<'MainPanelId'>;`.

## 5. Negative evidence (what did **not** change)

```console
$ git -C D:\deepseek-harness grep -l "usePanelInfo" dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1 -- packages apps | wc -l
0
$ git -C D:\deepseek-harness grep -l "usePanelInfo" dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1 -- packages apps | wc -l
47

$ git diff --stat dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1..dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1 -- packages/client/ui-slots
 packages/client/ui-slots/package.json | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

The session-format seams **leg A** owns (`assistant/message.stream`, `SessionHandleReadResult`,
`EpochHeader.system`, `ctx.agent`, `Inbox`, `SystemPrompt.persona`, the V3 log generation) have
**no** implementation change in this range: the whole `packages/core/session/src` diff is the
two added event-type literals and one comment line shown above. `docs/web-styling.md` (theme
tokens) has zero changes in the range. The scanner therefore reports no leg-A hit here that is
not also a leg-A fact, and the card says so explicitly in §2's scope statement.

## 6. Peer-range semantics (semver 7.8.5, measured)

```console
$ node -e "const s=require('.../semver'); ..."
semver version: 7.8.5
">=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0"                                    -> false
">=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0 || >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0"         -> true
">=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0"                                -> true
">=0.1.5-rc.1 <0.2.0"                                   -> true
">=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0 || >=0.1.5-rc.1 <0.2.0"         -> true
alpha.1 satisfies >=0.1.5-alpha.1 <0.2.0 -> true
```

This is npm semver's prerelease-tuple rule: a prerelease version only satisfies a set when
some comparator on the same `[major, minor, patch]` tuple carries a prerelease. It is the
same rule behind the workspace's recorded `>=0.1.0-rc.8 <0.2.0` incident.

## 7. Real-world cross-check on the family workspace

Slot usage was extracted from **tracked** sources only (`git ls-files`, production files,
`node_modules`/`lib`/`dist`/docs snapshots excluded) across the 47 repositories under
`D:\Projects\dsh\plugins`:

```console
== PRODUCTION: 8 distinct keys ==
  conversation.input.left                 <- dsh-autotier, dsh-talk
  conversation.session.header.actions     <- dsh-auto-review, dsh-session-pin, dsh-ticktick
  settings.plugin.item                    <- dsh-github, dsh-ticktick
  settings.plugins.tab                    <- dsh-autotier, dsh-budget, dsh-checkpoint-rewind,
                                             dsh-draw, dsh-mcp-panel, dsh-reach, dsh-talk
  settings.section                        <- dsh-background-agents, dsh-memento,
                                             dsh-permission-rules, dsh-wechat
  shell.overlay                           <- dsh-session-pin
  sidebar.footer.action                   <- dsh-background-agents, dsh-session-pin
  tool.call.toolview                      <- dsh-draw
== TESTS: 1 distinct key ==
  session-1                               <- dsh-auto-review:test/client-registration.spec.ts
                                             (a Remote face's `options.inject(...)`, not the
                                              slots service — false positive, excluded)

$ # tracked sources across all 47 repos, same pattern
inject('conversation'  |  name: 'conversation'  |  sidebar-textpreview
(zero hits)
```

8 production keys across 15 repositories; the rc.1 deletion set is `{conversation}`, so all
8 survive. This is why the family's rc.1 CHANGELOG entries are pin-only, e.g.
`dsh-autotier/CHANGELOG.md:14`, `dsh-mcp-panel/CHANGELOG.md:16`,
`dsh-plugin-guide/CHANGELOG.md:22`, `dsh-permission-rules/CHANGELOG.md:69` (identical
wording). **The prior research pass recorded nine keys**; the ninth it listed,
`conversation.chat.node`, occurs in this workspace only inside
`dsh-plugin-guide/references/official-docs/` (a downloaded official-docs snapshot), never in
family plugin code. The card states the measured eight.

Related recorded behaviour, unchanged by this hop: `dsh-permission-rules/CHANGELOG.md:100`
describes `isUnmarkedHostVersion` treating the `0.1.5-alpha` line as non-stamping, so an
envelope-level `ignorable` write is silently dropped there. Since
`packages/session` + `packages/core` carry no substantive `ignorable` change in this range,
rc.1 inherits that behaviour.

## 8. Model catalog default

```console
$ git log --oneline -1 bc5fd3b8dc
bc5fd3b8dc feat(llm): default Chat Completions to DeepSeek V41 Flash

$ git show dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1:packages/llm/llm-deepseek/src/index.ts   # DEFAULT_MODELS ids
id: 'deepseek-v4-flash' / 'deepseek-v4-pro' / 'deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp'
$ git show dsh-v0.1.5-rc.1:packages/llm/llm-deepseek/src/index.ts      # DEFAULT_MODELS ids
id: 'deepseek-flash' (name: 'DeepSeek-V41-Flash') / 'deepseek-v4-flash' / 'deepseek-v4-pro' /
'deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp'
```

The rc.1 README's `models` default row reads "V41 Flash + V4 Flash + V4 Pro + V4 Flash
Vision Exp". **Unverified:** that position 0 of the advisory catalog is *formally* the
selection default — no `DEFAULT_MODELS[0]` read appears in the adapter source. The card
therefore states what was measured (the catalog contents and the commit subject) and does
not claim a selection rule.

## 9. Package name availability

Re-measured for the merged package name on 2026-09-11 (the merged repository keeps this
record; the two retired names are the controls that prove the registry answers):

```console
$ npm view dsh-plugin-upgrade-0.1.3-0.1.5 version
npm error code E404
npm error 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/dsh-plugin-upgrade-0.1.3-0.1.5 - Not found
npm error 404  The requested resource 'dsh-plugin-upgrade-0.1.3-0.1.5@*' could not be found or you do not have permission to access it.
(exit 1)

$ npm view dsh-plugin-upgrade version dist-tags.latest      # control: retired leg A still exists
version = '0.1.3'
dist-tags.latest = '0.1.3'
$ npm view dsh-plugin-upgrade-rc1 version dist-tags.latest  # control: retired leg B still exists
version = '0.1.0'
dist-tags.latest = '0.1.0'
$ npm view @deepseek-ai/dsh-skill@0.1.5-rc.2 version         # control: the merged dev pin is published
0.1.5-rc.2
```

## 10. Not verified (kept out of the card's claims)

- **L9 (real browser).** No browser assertion was executed in the environment that produced
  this package; the card marks it as a hard requirement for the reader and records it as
  unexecuted here.
- **L11 (real model credentials).** Not reproducible without credentials.
- Whether any family repository ever pinned `0.1.5-alpha.2` (not checked per repository).
- Whether `packages/client/*` contains plugin-author-facing breakage outside the public slot
  and service catalogs (no full export diff of the 432 changed client files).
- Whether upstream intends to publish a migration note for the `conversation` removal; the
  card records the absence of one as of 2026-09-10.

## A. Leg A provenance (`0.1.3-alpha.1` → `0.1.5-alpha.1`)

Leg A's provenance does **not** live in this file. It lives in the retired
`dsh-plugin-upgrade` package's version card,
`skills/plugin-upgrade-015/references/v0.1.3-alpha.1-to-v0.1.5-alpha.1.md`, which the merge
brought in as the merged card's **§1 Leg A** — verbatim, including its `path:line` citations,
its measured scale and its boundary notes.

What that leg's provenance records, so a reader of this file can find it without the retired
package:

| Item | Leg A's recorded value |
|---|---|
| Card that holds the evidence | retired `dsh-plugin-upgrade` card, now merged card §1 Leg A |
| Run | 2026-09-09 wave over **40 real plugin repositories** |
| Leg-A host checkout | `0.1.5-alpha.1`, HEAD `19d2e38480`; official tag `dsh-v0.1.5-alpha.1` = `5dda764ed3` |
| Seams measured | `S1`–`S10` + `M1` (the merged card's §1 sections 1–5, with the per-seam host path and commit) |
| Reproduce | CLI `dsh-plugin-upgrade-015-scan --repo <repo>` (then `dsh-plugin-upgrade-scan`), `file:line` output |
| `M1` scale | **11 of 40** repos hit the stale type line; fixing the paths exposed real TypeScript errors in **3** repos that had been "green" |
| `S3` scale | one measured case (`dsh-claude-move`: import succeeded, `Session.fromRestore` refused to resume) |
| `S8` scale | `dsh-background-agents` production code `src/tools.ts:713` (`TS2740`) plus two tests; `dsh-output-styles` `scripts/verify-session-log.mjs` threw a TypeError |
| `S9` scale | four repos' test fixtures (`dsh-data-quality`, `dsh-industry-research`, `dsh-research-report`, `dsh-fast`; `TS2353`) |
| Leg-A official precedent cited | `apps/cli/tests/profiles/headless/tests/harness.ts:59` |
| Leg-A unverified | real-browser L9 and real-model L11 were not executed there either (recorded in that card's §7) |

The merged repository re-measured leg A's seams against its own fixtures
(`fixtures/leg-a-bad-repo` / `fixtures/leg-a-good-repo`) rather than re-running the 40-repo
wave: the fixture pair pins the same error-severity seams the card names
(`S3`, `S8`, `S9`, `S4`, `S5`, `S6`, `M1` in the bad fixture; zero error hits in the good one).
Nothing in leg A's provenance was discarded by the merge, and nothing in it was re-derived
here — where the two legs disagree, the leg that measured the seam wins.
